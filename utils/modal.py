                    Annual targets are sourced directly from OFTW. Quarterly targets are derived using a data-informed methodology:
                    
                    - For each metric, the average share contributed by each quarter to the annual total was calculated based on complete historical years.
                    - Years with insufficient or incomplete data were excluded using volume-based thresholds to ensure reliability.
                    - Separate calculations were performed for **fiscal years (FY)** and **calendar years (CY)** to reflect seasonal patterns in donor behavior.
                    - These proportions were then applied to each annual target to produce custom quarterly benchmarks.
                    
                    The target generation process is fully documented in the `create_target_json.ipynb` notebook available in the [GitHub repository]({GITHUB}).
